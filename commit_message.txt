feat: Implement style guide and i18n

This commit introduces a style guide and internationalization (i18n) support.

- **Style Guide:**
  - Created a new style guide page at `/styleguide`.
  - Added components for typography, colors, and property catalogs.
  - Defined a comprehensive set of CSS variables for theming, including light and dark modes.

- **Internationalization (i18n):**
  - Integrated the `@nuxtjs/i18n` module for localization.
  - Added English (en) and Portuguese (pt-BR) locale files.
  - Configured i18n with a `no_prefix` strategy and default locale to `pt-BR`.

- **Project Structure:**
  - Moved the `public` directory to `app/public` to align with Nuxt 3 conventions.
  - Added new components, pages, and type definitions.

- **Documentation:**
  - Added an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for recording architecture decisions.

- **Dependencies:**
  - Added `@nuxtjs/i18n` and other dependencies.
  - Included `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
